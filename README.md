# Getting and Cleaning Data

## Overview:

This project is developed following the instructions presented in the *Getting and Cleaning Data* course, offered by the John Hopkins University in the Coursera learning platform. Our main goal is to get the data from a research about Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones, that is presented in a fuzzy and non-conform way, clean it and prepare a dataset that follows the tidydata guidelines.

The data presented to us comes from the [HAR dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones), sourced by the University of California, Irvine.

## File list:

- **CodeBook.md**: describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that we performed to clean up the data.
- **run_analysis.R**: our R script.
- **tidy_data.txt**: the tidy dataset output, containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject in the research.
- **README.md**: this file.

## How to run:

1. **Clone this repo** or download the files.
2. **Source** the "run_analysis.R" script in R or RStudio.
3. **Look for the tidy dataset** output "tidy_dataset.txt" in the project folder.
